# Verify out-of-the-box app placement requirements are met, according to Help Center Placement Requirements. For Android 8.0+ devices be sure to check the Apps view as well as the Home Screen Favorites row.


I have broken this down into 2 tests:

    - Check home app placement
    - Check Apps area placement

The test uses an array for the expected applications as follows:

    "Netflix", "YouTube", "Prime Video", "Disney+"

-Our device is running Android TV Os v12
-Some of the requested checks (such as for games) were not showing in our version of the OS
-This can be extended or modified easily by rearranging or adding to the array 
-
